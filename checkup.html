    <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
	<h3>People who experience mental illness often do not receive enough support to lessen the pain they go through. Most notably, selected have responded that their closest companions, families, or friends are unaware of the fact that the person is much in pain. This personal application enables the users to communicate with qualified doctors, therapists, and other patients near by to make the process more convenient.

<h1 style="color: #D94F50"><center>USABILITY TEST</center></h1>
<h4><a href="https://www.usertesting.com" target="_blank"><b>Usertesting.com</b></a> was used to get feedbacks from three different users. <li style="list-style-type:none;"><b>User 1</b> mentions, "the need of next and go back buttons, and labels of what the circles mean on 'Connect' page." <li style="list-style-type:none;"><b>User 2</b> mentions, "understands the purpose of this applicatoin and well designed but the navigation needs to be more stream line and was difficult to grasp the functionality of 'Connect'." <li style="list-style-type:none;"><b>User 3</b> mentions, "the navigation is clear, straightforward and the design was appealing."</h4>
<h1 style="color: #D94F50"><center>REFLECTION</center></h1>
<h4>The usability testing was very helpful in learning how one can navigate differently on the application. For the revision based on the feedbacks, a brief description or a clear label can be helpful in each page, highlighting the purpose and the functionality of each page. Since the application is a prototype, it would be interesting to incorporate some of the animation such as a sliding bar which the user can move freely from Never to Always, and the circles rotating from my profile and locating patients near by. More questions for the self-test would be added to complete the set.</h4>
