	<h3> We were tasked to redesign several pages of a website to improve their usability, visual
design, and responsiveness. We began by analyzing the usability of the original interface using the criteria from <a class="active" href="http:usability.gov" target="_blank">usability.gov</a>intuitive design, ease of learning, efficiency of use, and memorability.

  <h1>PROBLEM</h1>
<h3>The biggest problem we tackled was the reorganization of information from the Poshmark website. There were two main issues: 
  <li>It was combining a social media website and clothing website interface, which made it confusing for first-time users.</li>
  <li>The listings were organized through “Posh Markets” and also categorizing tabs at the top of the page, which is repetitive.</li> 
</h3>
<br><br>
<h1>GOAL</h1>
<h3>Our main goals with the redesign are as follows:
<li>Clear distinction between social media-esque feed and listings.</li>
<li>Reduce the two forms of organization into one.</li>
<li>Minimalist, clean design that is intuitive and memorable.</li>
</h3>

  <h1>PROTOTYPING</h1>
  <h3><li>Landing/sign-in page with Google and Facebook login features</li>
  <li>Sign up page - “Posh Parties” description for first-time users</li>
  <li> Redesigned home page. The “Feed” tab is where you can view accounts that you follow. “Posh Market” is replaced by “Filter by” for clarification.</li>
  <li>"Listings" tab, where all listings on Poshmark are available. This page shows the listings under "All Categories".</li>
  <li>Options in the “Filter by” dropdown menu (originally “Posh Market”).</li>
  <li>The next set of filters in the dropdown menu is triggered by hovering.</li>
  <li>Redesigned user profile. Followers/following and listings/shares are now in separate lines and are clearly distinguishable.</li></h3>

<h1> Responsive Page.</h1>
<h3>We used a different grid for  mobile version for better organization. The grids used for the mobile version are:
<li>Margin-left: 20px</li>
<li>Margin-right: 20px</li>
<li>Font size: 21px for heading, 16px for body text</li>
The layout of the image and text boxes are stacked on top of each other. The navigation bar stays sticky on the top.</h3>

 <h1>USABILITY TESTING</h1>
 <h3><li>User 1 navigated through the interface as we intended. She likes how the redesign is simple and clean, and likes the new form of organization (markets). She thinks the icons at the bottom left should be moved to the top right. She says she was a little lost and didn’t know where to look at on the landing page.</li>
  <li>User 2 mentions that she was confused by the 3-way split-screen layout. She says she was confused about the intention in general because she’s personally conditioned to separate social media and clothing website interfaces. She thinks the redesign is nice and less chaotic compared to the original.</li>
  <li>User 3 prefers organization by category tabs at the top. She was confused about what “Parties” are, and also thinks that the icons at the bottom left should be moved to the top right. She thinks the redesign is better and simpler, and the original website is chaotic. She thinks the original website’s aesthetic and brand identity is somewhat boring, and seems to be targeted towards an older audience. She mentioned the incorporation of personalized profiles, such as tumblr’s customizable blogs.</li></h3>

 <h1>REVISION</h1>
 <h3>There is still confusion on where to click on the landing page. Possibily, we can show what are Parties and Brands with visual representation or icons underneath the menu. The Bundles icon can also have an intro animation of what it is for. With less clustering text orientation on mobile verison would be helping to see the contents more coherently.</h3>
